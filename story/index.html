      <h2>The story of the house</h2>
      <p>The town of Gabii is shaped like the <a href="#">flattened skeleton of a fish, a long curved spine with ribs splayed out, running off either side</a>. It sits on the southern slopes of a low conical mound with a crater in its middle; a bit of landscape whose topography was defined by a long dormant volcano. The town’s main east west thoroughfare traces the contour of the slopes of the crater, near the base of the mound. Between this road and the rim of the crater that defines the northern limit of the town, a series of terraces rise up. South of the road, the town continues across more level terrain.</p>
      <p>Once upon a time in this town there was a house. In fact there were a number of houses, but this story is about a particular house built two terraces north of the main road, and one block east of a particularly important side street that runs down the slope from the crater’s rim to join up with the Via Gabina, which links Rome to Praeneste. The location of this house, tucked just off this crossroad, gives shape to its story.</p>
      <p>To tell the story of this house, we must begin before the house was built and even before the streets that defined the limits of the property were laid out, or the terraces cut into the bedrock. At this time, huts, yards and other small structures, some grouped into compounds and ringed with their own walls, were scattered across the slope of the crater. In the place where our house will be built there is someone living or working. We can’t say much about these early occupants because the traces of their actions were by and large erased by later events. We see a scrap of a floor - a compact clay surface, disconnected bits of stone-built architecture, and a few cuts in the bedrock that may have served as drains or as foundation trenches for walls. Whatever these people were doing was disrupted by a thorough reorganization of the town in the late 5th or early 4th c. BCE. The decision was taken to lay out a network of streets that would divide the slope and plain below into a series of long narrow blocks. Within each block terraces delimited by rock-cut roads provided relatively flat areas on which new structures could be built. Our house is built in a space defined by a street on the west, and terrace cuts on the north and south. The eastern limit of the property is not defined by any feature of the skeleton of streets and terraces that provide the physical frame for the town beginning in the late 5th c. BCE. It does end, roughly half-way to the next street over.</p>
      <p>After a pause where the block may have stood empty, the building of the house begins in the early 3rd c. BCE – roughly 280-260 BCE with the serious business of creating a level and well drained surface. We see a large cut into the bedrock to construct a level terrace, and installation of channels cut into the bedrock, designed to funnel water south down the slope, and then soil and rubble spread across the site where the house will appear. The initial outlines of the house are simple enough, a large rectangular courtyard flanked on its eastern side by three rooms. The courtyard may be entered from the west through a doorway onto the north-south running side street. The walled courtyard space was built open to the sky, and a well was set into the ground in the northern part. The rooms themselves are entered from the courtyard. The roofs slope outward, dumping rainwater into drains running along the exterior walls of the house. The house is built almost exclusively of local stone - the lapis gabinus quarried just up the hill.</p>
