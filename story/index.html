        <p>The town of Gabii is shaped like the <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_more-street-grid;view=fulltext#p_more-street-grid">flattened skeleton of a fish, a long curved spine with ribs splayed out, running off either side</a></span>. It sits on the southern slopes of a low conical mound with a crater at its center; a bit of landscape whose topography was defined by a long-dormant volcano. The town’s main east-west thoroughfare, the Via Gabina, traces the contour of the slopes of the crater, not far from the base of the mound, linking Rome to Praeneste. Between this road and the rim of the crater that defines the northern limit of the town, <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_more-terraces;view=fulltext#p_more-terraces">a series of terraces</a></span> rise up. South of the road, the town continues across more level terrain.</p>
        <p id="p_story-topography">Once upon a time in this town, there was a house. In fact, there were a number of houses, but this story is about a particular house: the Tincu House. This house was built two terraces north of the main road and one block east of a particularly important side street that runs down the slope from the crater’s rim to join up with the <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_more-via-gabina;view=fulltext#p_more-via-gabina">Via Gabina</a></span>. The location of this house, tucked just off this crossroad, gives shape to its story.</p>
        <p id="p_story-prestructure">To tell the story of this <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=div3_more-phase1a-structure;view=fulltext">house</a></span>, we must begin before the house was built and even before the streets that defined the limits of the property were laid out or the terraces were cut into the bedrock. At this time, huts, yards, and other small structures, some grouped into compounds and ringed with their own walls, were scattered across the slope of the crater. In the place where our house will be built, someone is living or working. <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=div2_more-prestructure;view=fulltext">Later events largely obscure the actions and lives of these early occupants, but we know they were there.</a></span> We see a scrap of a floor—a compact clay surface, disconnected bits of stone-built architecture, and a few cuts in the bedrock that may have served as drains or as foundation trenches for walls. A <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_more-streetnetwork;view=fulltext#p_more-streetnetwork">thorough reorganization</a></span> of the town in the late 5th or early 4th c. BCE disrupted whatever these people were doing. The decision was taken to lay out a network of streets that would divide the slope and the plain below into a series of long narrow blocks. Within each block, terraces delimited by rock-cut roads provided relatively flat areas on which new structures could be built. Our house is built in a space defined by a street on the west and terracing cuts on the north and south. The eastern limit of the property ends roughly halfway to the next street over, but it is not defined by the skeleton of streets and terraces that provide the physical frame for the town.</p>
        <p id="p_story-phase1a-structure">After a pause when the block may have stood empty, the building of the house begins in the <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_more-phase0-transition;view=fulltext#p_more-phase0-transition">early 3rd c. BCE—roughly 280-260 BCE</a></span>—with the serious business of creating a level and well-drained surface. We see a large cut into the bedrock to construct a level terrace, as well as the installation of channels cut into the bedrock, designed to funnel water south down the slope. Soil and rubble are spread across the building site where the house will <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=div2_more-borgo-comparanda;view=fulltext">appear</a></span>. The initial outlines of <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=div3_more-phase1a-structure;view=fulltext">the house</a></span> are simple enough, a large rectangular courtyard flanked on its eastern side by four rooms. The courtyard is entered from the west through a doorway onto the north-south side street. The walled courtyard space was built open to the sky, and a well was set into the ground in the northern part. The rooms themselves are entered from the courtyard, and some may have connected to one another. The roofs slope outward, dumping rainwater into drains running along the exterior walls of the house. The house is built almost exclusively of local stone—the lapis Gabinus quarried just up the hill.</p>
        <p id="p_phase1b-renovation">What happened in the house when it was in its first, simplest form? The usual things, we must suppose. People lived there, <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_more-zooarch;view=fulltext#p_more-zooarch">cooked and ate</a></span>, argued and <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_more-coins;view=fulltext#p_more-coins">misplaced things</a></span>, swept and trod down the floors.</p>
        <p>Sooner or later, as often happens with houses and their occupants, the domestic arrangements proved unsatisfactory—not enough space/light or just things wearing down a bit. The floors in the eastern rooms are <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_phase-1b-renovation;view=fulltext#p_phase-1b-renovation">redone</a></span>—scraped, leveled, re-packed, and resurfaced. A series of new rooms are added along the southern edge of the courtyard, providing more places to keep things, work, or have a bit of privacy. The house is still a house—just a nicer one with some extra rooms and new floors. Then the change comes.</p>
        <p id="p_story-phase2-transformation">What makes a family leave their home or allow it to be <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=div3_more-phase2-transformation;view=fulltext">transformed into something that is not a home</a></span>, even if they still own it? We can’t say, but we know it happened here. The house stops being a house, and a complete transformation into a place with another purpose begins. Two large rooms are added on the northern end of the house, taking over part of what had been an open courtyard. The door through the wall on the western side of the courtyard is blocked up, and a new entrance to the courtyard is built from the south, fronting on a drive that branches off the north-south road that runs up from the Praenestina. A small vestibule is built between the new doorway and the courtyard. Further rooms, small and confining, are added on the southern side of the courtyard, and a large basin is installed in the courtyard, taking up more than its fair share of space. A new wall is added in the courtyard, running parallel to the line of the original rooms, blocking off the formerly easy access to them. The kinds of stones used to build the walls are changed, with the <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-tufo;view=fulltext#p_details-tufo">local lapis Gabinus swapped out for the lighter if less durable </a></span>tufo lionato. The sewers and drains that used to collect water running off the eaves outside the house are closed off. The roofs are rearranged, and instead of water dumping outward and running away from the property, it is gathered inward, pouring down the sloping tiles into the courtyard, perhaps spouted into the new central basin.</p>
        <p id="p_story-phase2-why">Why do all this? Why invert the roofs, block the drains, install a basin, add walls, and close and open doorways. It’s clear at this point that <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_more-phase2-annex;view=fulltext#p_more-phase2-annex">the house no longer works as a house</a></span>. But it looks like a house, at least as seen from the interior of the courtyard or from the road looking across the threshold. There would be roofs, a basin to catch water, and some surrounding rooms—all the things one might expect. Like a stage set of a house, there’s no home behind it, but the look is good. What’s behind the facade?</p>
        <p id="p_story-phase2-structure">For a time, the rooms behind the courtyard remain in use, serving some unknown, backstage purpose. Offices, storage, or something along those lines seem likely. The spaces certainly aren’t well lit, easily accessed, or prominently positioned. This transformation, from a house into a something else, seems to be associated with the arrival of new neighbors. The installation of a large public complex one block to the west doubtless affected the story of this house. Its presence seems the most likely explanation for the radical change witnessed here: the transformation from a house into an annex. This conversion from private domestic to “other use” space requires some <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_more-pompeii-comitium;view=fulltext#p_more-pompeii-comitium">explanation</a></span>. To propose an answer, we must stretch the limits of imagination. Maybe this public complex needed an administrative area. Maybe the house lot was bought and transformed, effectively split into two parts. In the former courtyard, the new walls, rearranged roofs, and basin create the illusion of standing in the interior court of a modern house. Hiding behind the domestic facade are spaces that might work for official business and storage. Together, these spaces create the illusion of the public parts of a house, with functional, if inconvenient, spaces hidden from view.</p>
        <p>Something like this must have happened. We can be certain there is a transformation from a place that acts as a house, with fairly modest and uncomplicated spatial arrangements and a look as much rural farmhouse as contemporary urban dwelling, into a place that looks like a more modern “Roman” house but doesn’t act as one.</p>
        <p id="p_story-phase3-transition">The activities that required the illusion of a house wind down or shift elsewhere. The rooms hidden behind the facade are <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=div3_more-phase3;view=fulltext">repurposed again, as quarrying</a></span> in this part of the city creeps south down the slopes. The northern wall of the house comes down, and dumps accumulate within some of the rooms, while others remain used for something that required a <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_more-phase3-active;view=fulltext#p_more-phase3-active">clear space in reasonable repair</a></span>. Eventually, the whole place is given up.</p>
        <p>The basin in the courtyard is removed, and rubble and dirt are dumped in fits and starts. Over time, this space fills with debris. The walls of the house come down; whether of their own accord or through intentional removal is uncertain. The useful material is carted off elsewhere, and <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=div3_more-phase3;view=fulltext">more dirt accumulates</a></span>. In the end, there is no longer a house, a facade of a house, or a rough repurposed industrial space. There is just an empty lot once more. Then the next thing happens.</p>

        <a name="2.1"></a><h3><span class="rend-i">The Tincu House architecture in its broader archaeological context</span></h3>
        <p id="p_more-gabii-context">The archaeological significance of the story of this house can only be understood in the broader context of the development of Roman urbanism and that of urban and rural domestic architecture in the second half of the first millennium BCE. We begin with two premises: first, that the people building houses and laying out urban infrastructure at Gabii, a top-tier settlement that emerged during the same wave of urbanization in central Italy that brought us Rome, were engaging with many of the same influences, ideas, and examples as their Roman neighbors to the west; second, that in the context of ongoing experimentation with ways to make towns and live urban life in central Italy, the specifics of the division of private and public areas and the layout and form of structures should provide insights into the Gabines' specific experiments in urbanism.</p>
        <p>The excavated sequence at the Tincu House speaks to these larger questions in two important ways. First, at a basic level, it adds a new item to the small collection of excavated exemplars of Early Republican and Mid-Republican domestic architecture in an urban context and encourages us to consider the particular requirements of urban housing at this time. Second, it allows us to observe and date, with greater precision than previously possible, some crucial transformations in the trajectory of occupation at Gabii. Specifically, it clarifies the tempo and dynamics of the transition from the sparse and scattered settlement that allegedly characterized the Iron Age phase (Guaitoli 1981b; also seemingly supported by the findings in Area A and Area D of this project’s excavations as published in Mogetta and Becker 2014) to the full-fledged city of the Hellenistic period, which was distinguished by the semblance, if not the reality, of a continuous urban fabric (Mogetta 2014; Mogetta and Becker 2014). Given these premises, while acknowledging that we know relatively little about the form and function of houses in an urban context during the Early Republican and Mid-Republican periods and equally little about the dynamics of dividing up a city to create public and private properties, we turn to the specifics of the excavated sequence and materials.</p>

        <a name="2.2"></a><h3><span class="rend-i">The House Lot</span></h3>
        <p id="p_more-street-grid">The urban fabric at Gabii is influenced by the natural topography of the landscape, a gentle slope running south from the rim of the crater of a defunct volcano. The <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-topography;view=fulltext#p_details-topography">slope is cut back</a></span> in places, forming a series of terraces and areas of level ground on which to build. The terraces were likely created sporadically as areas of the future town were occupied, as evidenced by the uneven intervals and varied elevations at which they appear. Around the late 5th or early 4th c. BCE, a substantial formalization of the layout of the town is enacted through the construction of a system of streets. A main thoroughfare runs along a contour near the base of the crater rim, with streets radiating upslope and downslope from it, defining blocks of roughly regular widths.</p>
        <p id="p_more-via-gabina">This main thoroughfare exits the town near the site of the “Santuario Orientale” (Fabbri 2011; Fabbri, Musco, and Osanna 2012) and continues in the direction of Tibur. It certainly connects Rome and Praeneste, through Gabii, from the 1st c. BCE onward, following the systematization of the consular road known as Via Praenestina, though it may have served more local traffic for the earlier period and hence is referred to simply as the Via Gabina in this volume (see Mogetta and Becker 2014, 174 nn. 5–6, for a discussion).</p>
        <p id="p_more-terraces">The sloping topography of the elongated block where the Tincu House was to be constructed was regularized by cutting a series of horizontal terraces into the bedrock. As one moves uphill from the thoroughfare toward the rim of the crater, at least three terrace levels are present.</p>
        <p>Nearby Praeneste provides a roughly contemporary parallel for this form of urban development, notably the terraced structures of the “Borgo” (dated to ca. 200 BCE: Demma 2010–2011, 11–26), though this is a sanctuary site. For a much earlier example in the domestic sphere, we cite the ad hoc project of regularization of the bedrock and construction of ashlar walls and an associated drainage system at the San Giovenale acropolis (dated to ca. 600 BCE: synthesized in Boëthius 1978, 74–75; Colonna 1986, plate VIII).</p>
        <p>The Tincu House sits on the middle terrace, tucked between another property to the north, likely domestic, and a property at the level of the thoroughfare, excavated by the Soprintendenza of Rome and seeming to contain the remains of domestic architecture succeeded by public structures, possibly commercial (Angelelli and Musco 2013, 728–729, 734 figs. 2–3). The built structures that make up the Tincu House only occupy half the width of the block defined by the roads bounding the area to the east and west. The use of the eastern half of the block at the time of the occupation of the house is uncertain, as most traces were obliterated by later quarrying activity.</p>
        <p id="p_phasing">We group the strata and structures that occupy the house lot into four phases, representing key changes in the activities or main purpose of the area over the course of its occupation. <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=div3_details-phase0;view=fulltext">Phase B-0</a></span> encompasses the features present on the lot prior to the construction of the first recognizable incarnation of the Tincu House. <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=div3_details-phase1;view=fulltext">Phase B-1</a></span>, which we subdivide into Phases B-1a and B-1b, represents the domestic use of the area, including the construction and a substantial renovation of the house. The original plan of the house (Phase B-1a) was subdivided into a large courtyard (approximately 10 × 17.5 m) and a row of rooms running down the east side; later (Phase B-1b) rooms were added along the southern side of the house, enlarging it slightly. In its initial construction, the house boasted paved floors, a well capped in monumental tufo slabs, drains to keep the courtyard relatively dry, and well-dressed ashlar masonry on the exterior facade of the wall. <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=div3_details-phase2;view=fulltext">Phase B-2</a></span> encompasses the transformation of the property from a domestic space to an area serving as an annex for the public complex across the road to the west. The area was renovated and rearranged together with the paved northeast-southwest street (Road 4) that separates the Tincu House’s lot from the lot of the public building to the west. Key alterations include a new entrance, whose <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1400')">threshold remains in situ, together with the marks of the doorposts</a></span>, reflecting a significant change in the use of this space. <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=div2_details-phase3;view=fulltext">Phase B-3</a></span> includes all activities related to the abandonment of the site, prior to its transformation into a necropolis (see Mogetta and Becker 2014 for remarks on the necropolis phase and the later sequence in this area).</p>
        </div>
        <a name="div2_more-prestructure"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="div2_more-prestructure">
        <a name="2.3"></a><h3><span class="rend-i">Before the House: The Early Iron Age and the Orientalizing, Archaic, and Early Republican Periods: Pre-Structures and Landscaping</span></h3>
        <p id="p_more-intro-prestructure">Few elements of the structures and occupation surfaces present on this property lot before the construction of the house survive. These elements comprise the <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=div3_details-phase0;view=fulltext">Phase B-0 assemblage</a></span>. The truncation of the archaeological strata was particularly deep in the north sector of the lot, and no evidence of occupation pre-dating the house was identified in this area. In spite of generally poor preservation, some traces of early activity have been identified in the southeast sector of the lot, directly on the bedrock. A curvilinear trench, several compact surfaces, fragmentary rubble walls, and associated layers were obliterated by the leveling of the terrace prior to the construction of the house, leaving only a few traces preserved under the subsequent construction near the southern limit of the terrace.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to interpret these structural scraps with any certainty or detail. We suggest that there was a built interior space, evidenced by the floor surface, and that the traces of burning indicate either domestic or production activities. The first properly interpretable evidence belongs to Phase B-1, when the house is constructed.</p>
        <div class="figure">

        <p>The date of these scant remains is likewise uncertain. Ceramics dated to the Early Iron Age or Orientalizing period are present in the deposit, though these are likely residual finds from earlier activity in the area. Similar traces of potential Orientalizing structures associated with infant burials of the suggrundarium type have been found directly upslope in Area A (Becker and Nowlin 2011).</p>

        </div>
        <p>This horizon, on top of which the house was later built, thus provides evidence for both early activity in the area and the broad destruction level tied to the later regularization of the topography and re-orientation of boundaries of properties as part of an apparently town-wide reorganization. In fact, the 5th c. BCE date of the latest deposits sealing the cuts in the bedrock corresponds well with the chronology already proposed for the creation of the town-wide orthogonal layout of the streets (Mogetta and Becker 2014).</p>
        <p>The definition of a series of elongated blocks, one of which comes to be occupied by the Tincu House, occurs together with the regularization of the topography mentioned above and the establishment of a formal street grid in the 5th c. BCE. This reorganization is transformational, structuring the urban area and defining its character for the whole of the Republican period. While we are convinced of the importance of the institution of an organized street system, what transpires within these newly defined spaces at the moment of their delimitation or for some time after remains uncertain. We have no direct evidence for occupation in the Tincu House’s block for the period between the 5th and early 3rd c. BCE. It seems certain that the area’s previous occupation is reorganized or removed entirely, as evidenced by the 5th c. BCE deposits over the early structural remains and cuts. The block may have remained empty, as seems to be the situation in Area D at Gabii (see the discussion in Mogetta and Becker 2014, 177–179). Alternatively, an early phase of occupation may be entirely masked by the later construction of the Tincu House, though this seems less likely. The relationship between the establishment of a formal street network and the infilling of individual blocks occurs gradually in other towns. We may cite a parallel situation at Pompeii, where the orthogonal blocks in the northwest and east sectors of town were laid out during the later 4th and 3rd c. BCE (Geertman 2007) whereas the infill with houses and shops is very gradual, intensifying in the late 3rd or early 2nd c. BCE (e.g., in the Regio VI: Coarelli and Pesando 2006, 2011). It is also notable that the Tincu House, as constructed in the Mid-Republican period, only occupies half the width of the blocks defined by the street grid, suggesting further subdivision of the blocks and a relatively complex system of property divisions.</p>

        <p>In Phase B-1a, we see the house as built on its original plan. The design of the house comprises an open courtyard bounded on its eastern side by four rooms. The house would have been entered from the west, by turning off the north-south side road (Road 4 in Figure 2) and coming through the courtyard. This entrance is not present as an opening in the wall separating the courtyard from the road, as found during excavation. Rather, a later patch in the western wall seems to indicate the location of the original entrance. The locations of the doorways into the eastern rooms in the house’s initial state are likewise uncertain. They may all have opened onto the courtyard, a good solution for letting in light and air, and interconnecting doors may have allowed for circulation between rooms.</p>
        <p>The construction of the house begins with the cutting of <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-earlydrains;view=fulltext#p_details-earlydrains">drainage channels</a></span> into the mostly leveled terrace and with the <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-levellayers1;view=fulltext#p_details-levellayers1">deposition of soil in some areas to create a compact, flat surface</a></span>. The organization of these channels is of particular interest, as their construction provides insight into strategies for water management, an enterprise that sits necessarily at the intersection of private interests and communal civic ones. The situation at the Tincu House is an early central Italian example of a private construction project operating with the constraints imposed by centralized urban planning.</p>
        <p>In the case of the Tincu House, channels were intended to capture water falling off the roof of the house and to carry it away from the property. During excavation, preserved channels were uncovered only on the northern and eastern sides of the house. Either the western and southern channels were removed or are masked by later activity, or the water management for this property did not require intervention to the south and west of the house. The latter seems unlikely, especially as we consider the extant channels more closely. A single channel runs along the north and east edges of the house, curving around the corner. The part of the channel north of the house is very badly preserved, barely visible as a shallow cut into the bedrock, though it is extant to a greater depth on its eastern end. On the east side of the house, in contrast, the channel is preserved to a greater depth, and we see a lining of basalt stones. This drainage channel is blocked with a <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_more-ceramics-drain;view=fulltext#p_more-ceramics-drain">fairly careful deposit, containing numerous well-preserved and nearly complete vessels</a></span>, when the house is transformed in Phase B-2. The state of preservation of the finds from the channel suggests an intentional deposition more than repeated dumping or natural accumulation, and it is specifically interpreted as indicating a change in the configuration of the roofs. A second channel joins the base of the eastern one and heads off to the southeast at an oblique angle. This channel is even deeper but curiously lacks a stone lining. We can propose that the construction of the channel was uniform and that we simply lack preservation on the northern side of the house, or we can suggest that the construction of the channel varied in response to the character of the bedrock and the architecture of the house. In support of the latter explanation, we note that the <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase1-rooms;view=fulltext#p_details-phase1-rooms">roofed rooms</a></span> are only on the eastern part of the structure, and consequently we may expect the eastern part of the channel to be built to accommodate more water and faster flows.</p>
        <p>Turning to the western side of the house, while we do not have a surface channel, there is a sub-surface channel running north-south, connected to a drain that emerges in the courtyard of the house and to the drainage system of the block to the west. Interestingly, this channel, roofed with tufo lionato slabs, runs along the interior of the <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase1-courtyard;view=fulltext#p_details-phase1-courtyard">courtyard wall</a></span>. Again we can propose two competing explanations. It is possible that a surface drain was built outside the courtyard wall on the west side of the house, paralleling the drain on the east (though we might expect a shallower construction like that seen to the north of the house, given the absence of a roof to shed water into this drain), and was later masked or removed when the property's western courtyard wall was rebuilt and when the structure was linked with the complex across the road. Alternatively, because the house's <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase1-courtyardwall;view=fulltext#p_details-phase1-courtyardwall">courtyard wall</a></span> meets the street on its western side, the entrance to the house from the street is here, and channels originating in the interior of the courtyard flow to this limit of the property, we can argue that the channel here would have been constructed sub-surface in the first place. In this case, the preserved segment revealed through excavation represents the original arrangement.</p>
        <p>Given the location of the house, with its southern limit just above the cut forming the step down to the next terrace, a channel on this boundary seems a functional necessity. <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_apologia-southern-limit;view=fulltext#p_apologia-southern-limit">Preservation at the southern limit</a></span> of the property is extremely poor, and no evidence of a channel is present, but it seems likely the house would have been surrounded by a complete circuit of drains. A similar arrangement of channels has been identified around the property to the north (Figure 3).</p>
        <div class="figure">

        </div>
        <p>While most of the infrastructure put in place at this early stage of the construction process is intended to carry water away from the walls of the house, there is also evidence of planning for the management of <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-courtyarddrains;view=fulltext#p_details-courtyarddrains">water within the open courtyard</a></span>. A covered channel carrying water out from the interior of the courtyard forms a Y junction with the covered drain running along the western limit of the house, and both join with the network of channels under the road located to the west of the property. This channel goes out of use as part of or just before the broad reorganization of Phase B-2. A well cut into the bedrock, covered by large worked tufo lionato slabs, was built in the northern part of the courtyard. In the original design of the house, this well is the only source of water within the property. If we return to the idea of water management as an activity at the interface between priorities of communal infrastructure and the needs of private households, the situation here suggests that individual households at Gabii continue to be responsible for water for their own consumption. The situation in this early stage in the process of urban organization and centralization, as understood through the areas excavated so far, is slightly different from that seen at Pompeii (see Lorenz and Wolfram 2014), where water for consumption comes both from private wells and from communal cisterns and pumps, prior to the construction of the city’s aqueduct.</p>
        <p>The construction and renovation of the structure of the house likewise shows instances of variations that may be interpreted as accommodations to suit both the property’s occupants and a developing program of coherent urban planning. We read differences in constructions that would be visible from the roads or exterior facades more generally and differences internal to the house as indicative of such accommodations.</p>
        <p>The construction techniques used for <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase1-walls;view=fulltext#p_details-phase1-walls">walls</a></span> identified as belonging to the first phase are diverse. A construction cut discovered in the bedrock runs the entire east-west length of the structure on its northern side and contains two preserved wall fragments, which likely form a single wall. This northern retaining wall was heavily robbed, but where it is preserved, the extant ashlar blocks reveal no trace of binding agents, though some show traces of horizontal cutting in the poor-quality tufo. The main internal wall, which divides the rooms along the east side of the house from the courtyard, is of similar construction and separates exterior from interior space. This wall is truncated at its southern end where it abuts the east-west wall that separates Rooms B1 and B6 in the southeast corner of the building. <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase1b;view=fulltext#p_details-phase1b">Two small fragments of walls</a></span> continue toward the southern wall along this axis. One is of mixed technique, including ashlar blocks, rubble, and tile inclusions, while the other was constructed in rubble of smaller size bound with clay. The eastern exterior wall of the structure is made up of at least two different ashlar walls. The wall of Room B3 is built slightly further east, creating a slightly deeper room. An opus quadratum wall divides Rooms B1 and B2, and a gap between the east wall of these two rooms and this wall suggests a possible entranceway. The wall dividing Rooms B2 and B3 is of mixed technique and again lacks conclusive evidence for a doorway, due to poor preservation. A long eastwest wall runs along what appears to be the southern limit of the structure and the property. This <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">southern wall</a></span> features a different building technique, consisting of irregular blocks and rubble. What are we to make of this hodgepodge of construction techniques?</p>
        <p>It seems likely that that the original construction’s builders consistently used a single technique, at least for each wall. Beyond this, we have conflated a series of minor repair episodes into a single phase, and episodes of repair are the main explanation for multiple techniques used in individual walls. As ashlar blocks in opus quadratum (using predominantly lapis Gabinus stone at least in the lower preserved courses of the walls) dominate the Phase 1a structure overall, we speculate that this technique was used in the original construction and that the opus mixtum and rubblework segments are indicative of later rebuilding. Within the opus quadratum tufo walls, we see two decidedly different qualities of stone and levels of workmanship. Notably, the western wall of the courtyard is built out of larger, more carefully dressed blocks than the other walls. The materials of this wall are dominated by lapis Gabinus, with patches of the lighter tufo lionato. This difference in quality may be explained by the presence of the public complex across the road (in which case the chronology of the construction of the final state of the wall remains uncertain) or simply by the fact that this wall faces the road. Either way, this would be the house's most publicly visible facade and seems to have warranted extra investment, initiated either by the house's owners or by the town. We can draw a parallel with Pompeii, where Wallace-Hadrill (2013, 41) interprets the distribution of the nicely appointed “Nocera tuff” facade architecture along Via dell’Abbondanza, Via Stabiana, and Via della Fortuna as a communal project of urban beautification.</p>
        <p>As we see evidence for wall repair during the occupation of the Tincu House in its original layout, we also see the <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase1-floors;view=fulltext#p_details-phase1-floors">floors</a></span> being resurfaced, with patches of preparation and leveling layers added. Remnants of a cocciopesto floor were identified in Room B1, with several layers of preparation under the floor preserved. While the floor and top preparation layers are truncated, the deepest preparation layer is intact, covering the whole room. Another crushed tufo floor is preserved in two small patches in Room B2. This floor abuts the dividing wall to the north and the east wall, clearly belonging to the same occupation phase. In Room B3, <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase1-room3floors;view=fulltext#p_details-phase1-room3floors">several layers</a></span> were deposited to raise the ground level for construction of the floor. Based on the remaining patches of floor preparation and surfaces, crushed tufo and cocciopesto floors would have been found in all the eastern rooms in the house's original construction and refurbished as needed. The courtyard of the house likewise had a floor, constructed with crushed red tufo and low-quality plaster, a technique that is attested elsewhere at Gabii (most notably in the Area C house: Gallone and Mogetta 2013). Although we have little indication of the finishing surface of the floor, the extant crushed tufo preparation layers would likely have benefited from some further treatment to protect against the elements. In any case, there are numerous examples of contemporary houses in which crushed tufo floors and more-refined cocciopesto floors coexist (e.g., at Norba: Carfora, Ferrante, and Quilici Gigli 2011, 398–399). Multiple episodes of repair during a phase of domestic use are likewise attested by the character of the finds from this phase, including spindle whorls, loom weights, and fragments of fibulae, which became incorporated into the structure.</p>
        <p id="p_phase-1b-renovation">We chose to identify a new phase (B-1b) when new walls are built and when the organization of the domestic space is altered. The main additions to the house associated with Phase B-1b, a set of small rooms, are located on the former southern limit of the house and enlarge it. These additional three rooms appear to have been built onto the house during a <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase1b-south;view=fulltext#p_details-phase1b-south">coherent episode of expansion</a></span> during its use as a residence. Two <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1448')">north-south walls</a></span> built in the same technique appear to be contemporary with a third wall sitting a short distance further west. A <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1441')">noticeable cut</a></span> that runs continuously, albeit slightly irregularly, along the edges of these walls delineates the additional space to the south <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1441')">of the original external wall of the house</a></span>. The poorly preserved remains of a floor sit within the westernmost of the three rooms defined by these walls and the cut. Such an addition of new rooms as part of the arrangement of the house is common enough. In this case, it results in an <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase2-south;view=fulltext#p_details-phase2-south">L-shaped suite of rooms</a></span> surrounding the central courtyard. The precise chronology of the addition of these rooms is uncertain. It may have been contemporaneous with one of the episodes of <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase1-floors;view=fulltext#p_details-phase1-floors">resurfacing the floors</a></span> and general structural repairs or a separate action. The salient point is that the owners and residents of the house re-invested in the structure, expanding the livable space and updating their arrangements, implying the continued value of the property as a home. The renovations notably do not move the house much further toward a "typical" atrium house plan (as seen broadly contemporaneously at Gabii in Area C: Mogetta and Becker 2014, 179–80 and fig. 9) but continue to maintain a simple layout.</p>
        <p>Within the area delimited by the new rooms, several features are preserved south of the <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">southern wall</a></span> of the house, as it was first built. A <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1454')">worked block</a></span> lies slightly southwest within this space and may have been once part of one of the new walls or used as a threshold. However, the alignment of this worked block and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1429')">two circular stone presses</a></span> suggests they have been displaced, an impression supported by all three floating above intact stratigraphy in the top soil. These features, therefore, are not considered in our consideration of the renovation and expansion activities.</p>
        <p>The Tincu House is clearly one in which the owners and occupants continually re-invest. Repair and maintenance activities take place periodically. A planned southern extension is undertaken, which would have required significant effort, though the real gain in space was limited. The house, as far as we know, is in a good state of repair when it ceases to be used as a domestic residence. There is no clear evidence for a period of abandonment or disuse prior to Phase B-2, the transformation of the house into an annex.</p>

        <p>The transformation from a house to what can be best characterized as an annex to the public complex across the road to the west (Gallone, Mogetta and Johnston 2016) is a marked one in terms of the use of the space but is deceptive in its alterations to the surface appearance of the structure. The property continues to look more or less like a house from the perspective of someone passing by on the road or standing in the courtyard, but it contains <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase2-split;view=fulltext#p_details-phase2-split">several notable oddities</a></span> that constitute the evidence that the area no longer functions as a residence.</p>
        <p>The first significant change comes as the entrance to the house located in its western wall is <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase2-westentrance;view=fulltext#p_details-phase2-westentrance">blocked up</a></span> and a <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase2-southentrance;view=fulltext#p_details-phase2-southentrance">new entrance</a></span> is constructed. This new entrance is accessed via a short drive paved in basalt that forms a Y junction off the main road. One would enter through double doors and step into a small enclosed entryway before entering the courtyard.</p>
        <div class="figure">
        <a href="/g/gabii/images/Figure4_more.jpg"><img src="/g/gabii/images/Figure4_more.jpg" alt="Figure 4: The new entrance to the courtyard, associated with Phase B-2 of the structure.

        </div>
        <p>The entryway room is too small for one to have done much more than take off shoes or simply pass through. As such, it is the first of several symbolic rooms or features within the annex—spaces that were built to look like part of a canonical domestic structure but could not have been functional. The internal space in the property is effectively split into two functional areas by <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase2-split;view=fulltext#p_details-phase2-split">two walls</a></span> that define a new, smaller courtyard space. The attenuated courtyard is, we suggest, dominated by a newly installed <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase2-drains;view=fulltext#p_details-phase2-drains">shallow basin</a></span>. The well in the courtyard may go out of use at this point; if it continues to be active, then walking around the north side of the basin becomes quite awkward. Certainly, the channel located in the southwest corner of the courtyard, which served to keep the courtyard drained, goes out of use, as the branch of the drain oriented toward the center of the courtyard is intentionally blocked. The constructions dated to this reorganization were built using a variety of materials, including tufo blocks in lapis Gabinus and tufo lionato, as before, but also travertine, rubble, basalt, and tiles. Some of these materials are likely reused from earlier constructions.</p>

        </div>
        <p>As part of the same rearrangement, the <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase2-drains;view=fulltext#p_details-phase2-drains">drains</a></span> running around the outside of the structure to the north and east are blocked, and <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase2-drains;view=fulltext#p_details-phase2-drains">soil is allowed to accumulate</a></span> in them. The combination of the closing of these drains and the construction of two new walls defining the courtyard points to a <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase2-split;view=fulltext#p_details-phase2-split">re-orientation of the roofs</a></span>. In the first phase, the roofs of the room sloped outward; in the second phase, their direction seems to be reversed, with their sloping faces visible from within the courtyard. To reverse the orientation of sloping roofs is no small job. Again the motivation for the rearrangements seems to be one of creating the appearance of a canonical house of a certain type. The installation of an impluvium-type feature and roofs oriented into the courtyard point to the look of an atrium house.</p>
        <p>There is no concrete evidence for <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase2-courtyarddoor;view=fulltext#p_details-phase2-courtyarddoor">doorways</a></span> leading from the redefined courtyard into the rest of the structure, though it seems likely one would have been present. The most probable location based on the remains of these later walls is in the southern part of the north-south wall between the courtyard and the rooms. This doorway would have led into a series of interconnected rooms, the pre-existing ones and two new, large rooms on the northern side of the courtyard, in the space created by the walls dividing the space. These rooms, which could not have been well lit or aired, more closely resemble what we see in storage or warehouse spaces than in the living areas of Italic or Roman houses. Taken together, the series of functional, if not pleasant, rooms and the non-functional courtyard that looks like the internal court of an atrium-style house (though the canonical alae are altogether missing) lead to our interpretation of this space as an annex. The suite of rooms could readily have functioned as storage or administrative space. The courtyard would have sufficed for loading or unloading of small goods or as a non-specific overflow or waiting area.</p>
        <p id="p_more-phase2-annex">While we cannot be precise about the activities that took place here in the second phase, it is certain that the property has been wholly subsumed by the business of the complex across the road. Whatever the function or functions of that complex, it required what is effectively back-office space, hinting strongly at a public or semi-public use and some administrative or business activities. Perhaps more interesting is the investment in creating the facade of a house as seen from the courtyard or the road just outside of it, combined with the location of a second, side entrance to the larger complex. Motivations for creating the look of a house in the “back rooms” of a public complex may hint at some connection between the idea of a house and the overall purpose of the complex.</p>
        <p id="p_more-pompeii-comitium">The case of the Comitium of Pompeii should be recalled in our discussion of the transformation of domestic urban space. In that instance, we have a public space that was created as part of the same project that resulted in the construction of the porticus at the south end of the Forum (the so-called Porticus of Popidius). During the creation of this space, a pre-existing atrium house was repurposed, with elements of the structure reused (Ball and Dobbins 2013, 474, 483, 470 fig. 2, 472 fig. 4).</p>
        <p>We also see the disjuncture between appearance and activities, the imitation of one canonical type in a place that is something else, in many of the small row houses at Pompeii. These row houses adopted some architectural elements of the atrium house at various stages of their occupation. The Casa del Bell’Impluvio is a famous example of a row house converted to imitate an atrium house (Sewell 2010, 132, 133 fig. 57). The dating of the restructuring of the Tincu House, then, seems to correspond with the period of maximum diffusion of this status-related design.</p>

        <a name="2.4.3"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Phase B-3: Disuse and Obliteration</span></h4>
        <p>The third phase defined for this area encompasses a variety of activities associated with the end of the life of the building as an annex and a new use of the area, for activities associated with quarries located to the north (see Mogetta and Becker 2014) and, eventually, as an informal dump. The <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase3-dumpnorth;view=fulltext#p_details-phase3-dumpnorth">northern rooms</a></span> are the first to be appropriated for refuse deposition associated with quarrying. The dumping activity pre-dates indicators of collapse and the accumulation of associated rubble. Therefore, it seems the courtyard and possibly the southeastern rooms continued to be used during the initial abandonment of the northern portion of the building.</p>
        <p>As <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase3-moredumps;view=fulltext#p_details-phase3-moredumps">refuse deposition intensified</a></span> throughout the building, structural modifications were made to accommodate the new purpose of the property. Three new walls were built, reflecting some investment in the reconfigured activities here. There is a slight northwest physical shift in terms of the orientation of the newest architecture. One of the walls is a relatively long north-south polygonal partition constructed turning slightly west from where it cuts the structure’s original exterior wall and obliterates it in sections. It extends north far beyond the property line, faced nicely on its western side toward the road, but leaving the eastern side with the rubble packing exposed. Again we see a clear emphasis on presenting the architecture to the traffic using Road 4 and presumably interacting with the large adjacent complex. This wall also cut the basalt re-pavement of Road 4 of the previous phase, indicating a general rise in the road that is mirrored in the courtyard.</p>
        <p id="p_more-phase3-active"><span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase3-newwalls;view=fulltext#p_details-phase3-newwalls">Two shorter walls</a></span> were constructed perpendicular to this large north-south wall and cut across the courtyard. These walls overlie the well-made tufo slab well covers and clearly denote the abandonment of the original occupational function of the property and its features. All three of these walls seem to be associated with the now-segmented northern part of the courtyard and the northern rooms currently being subsumed as a formal dumping ground for the activities further north of the structure. The new organization of the property reflects a series of decisions made by people conscious of interactions with the large multi-terrace complex to the west, the main arteries of the settlement to the south, and incipient Imperial quarrying activities to the north on the terrace above.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that a <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=p_details-phase3-moredumps;view=fulltext#p_details-phase3-moredumps">late floor</a></span> was constructed over the dump in the northeast room of the structure. It has no relationship with the pre-existing walls or other features, although it seems to respect the original boundaries of the room. While it is unclear what function this served, it clearly demonstrates that activity did not cease entirely. Other activities, expected given disuse, were prevalent as well, including the extensive robbing of building materials and the gradual accumulation of material through the mid-1st c. CE. Throughout the 1st c. CE, there are a variety of accumulation and dumping layers that variously respect different room and structure boundaries as the remains of the house became less and less visible. The refuse includes a wide range of materials, from personal adornments to iron slag, as well as a range of coins—all doubtless deposited out of their original context. We interpret these later dumps as representative of disuse, while the earlier dumps confined to the northern rooms are representative of industrial activity.</p>

        <a name="2.5"></a><h3><span class="rend-i">Relationships to contemporary domestic architecture at Gabii and in central Italy</span></h3>
        <p id="p_more-other-areas">The Tincu House represents the most complete example of domestic architecture known so far for the early phase of the orthogonally planned city. Within the Gabii Project excavation area, two other habitation contexts have been identified for this period. In Area A, a group of badly preserved structures and associated drainage channels has been investigated, providing a fragmented and partial view of the complex. Its discernible plan, however, seems to have elements in common with that of the Tincu House: an oblong tripartite wing facing an open court and delimited by drains on all sides. In another city block to the east, Area C, a much larger structure has been exposed, but its first phase is partially masked by a later restructuring that has been dated preliminarily to ca. 200 BCE.</p>
        <p id="p_more-template">The original plan of the Tincu House perpetuates a template that emerged in central Italy in the Archaic period. The basic habitation unit of the compound is an oblong rectangular building (5 × 17.5 m), whose interior is subdivided into a single row of smaller rooms. This wing opens onto a courtyard, which is twice as large (about 10 x 17.5 m; at a later stage, two rooms were added on its north short side) and bound on three sides by a carefully drafted ashlar wall. This type of domestic architecture is well attested in Archaic Latium, with a peak in the period between 600 and 450 BCE (e.g., Ficana, Rome-Sepolcretum, Torrino: synthesized in Lindenhout 2014, with fig. 2). Larger known compounds feature a symmetrical arrangement of the modular unit on both sides of the courtyard (a notable example is House A at Satricum, whose wings measure 5 x 25 m, with a courtyard three times as large). The presence of a well and/or a basin connected to a drainage system in the open courtyard also finds comparanda in Archaic contexts of the broader region, especially in Etruria (e.g., Houses I and II on the acropolis at San Giovenale, of smaller size: Izzet 2007, 149 fig. 5.2).</p>
        <p id="p_more-late-atrium">What is most remarkable about the new example from Gabii, therefore, is neither the architecture nor the building technique (with the exception of the technology used for the floor surfaces: see Gallone and Mogetta 2013). Many parallels can be suggested for the practice of using different building methods for different parts of the house. Most notably, the 3rd and 2nd c. BCE houses at both Pompeii (Pesando 2013) and Norba (Carfora, Ferrante, and Quilici Gigli 2013) show the use of more elaborate techniques for facades and load-bearing walls (at Pompeii, opus quadratum and limestone-framework technique, also known as “opus africanum,” in different combinations; at Norba, polygonal masonry), as well as clay-based mortared-rubble architecture for interior partitions. Remarkable, rather, is the fact that a centuries-old model was selected and fitted into the new layout of the city. This aspect is particularly interesting because it has often been suggested that the emergence of orthogonal town-planning in the Late Archaic period influenced parallel developments in house architecture, such as the introduction of designs based on axial symmetry (though this is inferred mostly from contemporary Etruscan funerary evidence: Colonna 1986, 447–448). It is also commonly believed that such early developments would ultimately bring about houses of the so-called Roman atrium type (for this tradition see Jolivet 2011; a case for such an early date has been made for Rome by Carandini and Carafa [1995] 2000). From a chronological standpoint, however, the evidence from Gabii may be used to support recent views that place the genesis of the canonical Roman atrium at a later stage (Sewell 2010, 129–130). The oldest atrium house at Fregellae was initially dated to the late 4th c. BCE (Domus 7: Coarelli 1995, 18–20; 1998, 62–65), but the chronology was later revised to the first half of the 3rd c. BCE (Pesando 1999, 245–246; Battaglini and Diosono 2010). At Pompeii, the earliest standard atrium houses documented by the Progetto Regio VI (Coarelli and Pesando 2006, 2011; Pesando 2010) seem to post-date the middle of the 3rd c. BCE (e.g., Casa del Naviglio), and what was once believed to be a well-dated example of the basic early template, the House of Sallust, has now been shown to be much later (ca. 140 BCE: Laidlaw and Stella 2014). In Rome, the Auditorium site features a standard atrium in its late 3rd c. BCE phase (De Davide and Di Giuseppe 2006). The urban fabric of both Cosa (Fentress 2003) and Norba (south neighborhood: Carfora, Ferrante, and Quilici Gigli 2010), though, reflects an intensive phase of expansion dating to the 2nd c. BCE.</p>
        <p>While the Area B structure seems to have never been updated along these lines, the Area C house was indeed provided with an atrium and an axial tablinum, though again only in its second phase. There, the new arrangement had to be fitted into the pre-existing topography, which explains both the lack of axial fauces and the presence of asymmetrical alae (one can perhaps observe a similar phenomenon in the Late Republican houses on the north slopes of the Palatine in Rome, which oddly are far less regular than their allegedly canonical predecessors: see the state of the evidence in Carandini and Papi [1999] 2005).</p>
        <p id="p_more-areaC">Further excavations in the city block of the house in Area C are needed to reveal whether the Tincu House is representative of a generalized pattern at Gabii. It is worth noting, in this respect, that another example of the architectural tradition reminiscent of the Archaic template, although in an expanded version, has been found in the countryside of Gabii: the so-called Via Gabina site 11 (Widrig 2002, Plan Phase 1b). The compact rectangular plan with elongated courtyard and three or more rooms on the long side characterizes Hellenistic rural buildings in Latium, Campania, Apulia, and southern Etruria (Torelli 2011, arguing for a derivation of the model from prototypes in Magna Graecia), so what we might be seeing here is an interesting case of parallel developments in both urban and rural contexts. </p>
        <p>The continuation of research at this long-lived primary site will undoubtedly enrich the dataset of urban domestic architecture for the period under discussion, which is mostly based on the evidence from cities that, unlike Gabii, were intentionally founded or re-founded as Roman colonies. Based on the available data, we can already suggest that the urban development at Gabii in the 3rd c. BCE is characterized by quite a different pattern, having originally little in common with the mass-construction projects attested at colonial sites like Fregellae. At the latter site, contemporary housing appears to be based on standardized designs, comprising the atrium house and the row house. The diffusion of individual elements of the Roman atrium house in the second half of the 2nd c. BCE may betray Roman influence. We know that, around the time when the Tincu House was transformed, the Roman family of the Cornelii Cethegi was involved in the monumental reconstruction of the sanctuary of Iuno Gabina (Coarelli 1982; Palombi 2015). Yet construction activities sponsored by Roman magistrates at Gabii are also attested in the 3rd c. BCE (at the site of the “Santuario Orientale,” where a Roman consul dedicated an altar: Fabbri 2012, 19 fig. 3), that is, in a building period that does not demonstrate a particular concern with imitating Roman models, at least in private architecture. The sequence of the Tincu House, then, should probably be interpreted as a specifically local response to broader architectural trends and stimuli, mediated through the particular social conditions, which ultimately produced a rather hybrid form.</p>

        <a name="2.6"></a><h3><span class="rend-i">Artifacts and Ecofacts from the Tincu House</span></h3>
        <p>The structural remains of the Tincu House provide us insight into the changing priorities of both the property’s owners/ inhabitants and the group steering Gabii’s centralized planning. The stratigraphic and structural remains provide evidence for four key moments in the town’s history: the organization of the town to have a coherent layout, the construction of domestic architecture, the growing influence of public institutions, and the shrinking of the inhabited area in favor of expanding industrial activities. The artifacts and ecofacts found within the property support and augment the picture painted by the stratigraphic and structural evidence.</p>

        <a name="2.6.1"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Ceramics from the Tincu House</span></h4>
        <p>The excavations carried out within the urban area of the ancient site of Gabii have uncovered a complex sequence of occupation spanning from the Mid-Republican period to the Early Imperial period. The study of the ceramic assemblage recovered from these stratigraphic deposits contributes significantly to our understanding of the material culture, society, and economy of the Latin town at that time. Until recently, the only available corpora of ceramics from contemporary contexts at Gabii were those from the votive deposits at the sanctuary of Iuno (Almagro Gorbea 1982), from the extraurban “Santuario Orientale” (Musco and Pilo 2006), and from the rural shrine at Ponte di Nona (Potter 1989), which is located about three miles from the urban center and has been interpreted as a healing sanctuary (see Musco 2006, with further bibliography). In all these cases, therefore, the ceramics represent activities typical of sanctuary sites. The activities associated with sanctuary sites, which we presume are dominated by votive depositions, feasting, and other acts of public consumption, lead to the overrepresentation of finewares and terracottas, as opposed to common and coarse wares in the assemblages. The study of the materials collected from the Area B house therefore not only provides the absolute chronology for its occupation and transformation but, importantly, allows us to chart the consumption and discard patterns associated with the occupation of domestic and urban non-religious public contexts. Equally important, the changing character of the deposits provides supporting evidence for major alterations in the character of the activities taking place.</p>
        <p>The chronology of the property has been established primarily based on the ceramics, with complementary evidence provided by the coins found in floor preparation layers. From the layers associated with Phase B-1 (and especially Phase B-1b) comes a large assemblage of objects (more than 5,000 fragments, corresponding to 36% of the total sample), which makes it possible to date the main building activities to between the first half of the 3rd c. BCE (Phase B-1a) and the late 3rd or early 2nd c. BCE (Phase 1b) with some confidence, revealing a general picture of the kinds of pottery in use in or near the habitation at that time. In Phase B-2, a few diagnostic elements, combined with the stratigraphic relationships, indicate a date within the second half of the 2nd c. BCE and the early or first half of the 1st c. BCE. Almost all the pottery from the Phase B-3 deposits are residues from Phases B-1 and B-2. The available dating elements, however, are consistent with a terminus post quem of the second quarter of the 1st c. CE for the final abandonment of the property, prior to its conversion into a necropolis.</p>
        <p id="p_more-ceramics-drain">The most representative group of materials related to the domestic occupation phase of the property, essential to its dating, has been recovered from the fill of the drain running along the eastern exterior wall of the house. The assemblage is outstanding not only in terms of quantity and quality but also for the state of preservation (several individual vessels have been fully or almost fully reconstructed). This suggests that the items deposited in the drain may have been part of the pottery set in use in the house itself, not secondary refuse. It is possible that the discard of the materials happened immediately before the restructuring of the house in Phase B-2. That this was the result of a single action and not of a series of dumps over a longer period of time is indicated by the fact that most elements can be dated to the same chronological range. The assemblage is dominated by finewares, including Black Gloss, Impasto, Bucchero, and a mixture of imported wares and locally produced specimens. A small number of amphorae and common wares are also present.</p>
        <p>The assemblage from Phase B-2, representing the transformation to a public space, comes from leveling layers for the floors rather than a drain deposit and, as such, is less likely to be representative of use on the property. Rather, we read these ceramics as representative of the materials in use in the neighborhood or across the town. The bulk of the assemblage is comprised of coarse wares, unsurprising given the use as packing. As such, it is not reasonable to associate the ceramics with activities connected to the use of the property as an annex. The information provided is purely chronological. It is similarly untenable to associate activities closely linked to the property with the ceramics belonging to the third phase, as a mixture of dumps and natural post-abandonment accumulations are present. In both cases, the materials dumped or accumulating represent activities taking place in other areas of the neighborhood and across the town. They do, however, provide a chronology for the industrial activities on the property and the active dumping phase.</p>

        <div class="textindentlevelx">
        <a name="2.6.2"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">The Coins from the Tincu House</span></h4>
        <p id="p_more-coins">As with the later ceramics, the coins found in the Tincu House paint a picture of the materials generally in circulation at Gabii during the periods in question, rather than representing the specific context of the house or the public space that succeeds it. Of eight coins found in the Tincu House, seven date to the 3rd c. BCE, beginning ca. 280 BCE and running up to the start of the new century. Of the datable coins, one can be confidently associated with the domestic phase of the property, three with its reorganization and transformation into an annex associated with the adjacent complex. All these coins were discovered embedded into floor preparation layers, explaining their survival in situ in the house, given its crushed tufo paved floors. The remaining coins, while dating to the years when the property was a house and then an annex, were found in dumping layers associated with industrial processing related to the quarries and represent secondary or tertiary depositional contexts. Most of the coins originate in relatively local mints in Rome and appear to have circulated for some time, as indicated by their highly eroded faces. They are generally bronze, lightweight, and of a low denomination.</p>
        <p>Overwhelmingly, the coins cluster around two epochs: the turn of the second quarter of the 3rd c. BCE and the last quarter of that century. This reflects the production pattern of Roman coinage during the late Early Republican and Mid-Republican periods. At the beginning of the 3rd c. BCE, Rome utilized a variety of bronze currencies, in addition to very limited issues of silver coinage. Indigenous Roman currency was based on large weights of bronze: aes rude, aes signatum, and the casted aes grave. When Rome adopted coined silver and bronze, the earliest issues were derived from the coins minted in Southern Italy, particularly the coinage of Neapolis (Burnett 2012, 300). As a result, due to the legends, types, or weight of some of these early issues, they are believed to have been minted at a South Italian mint for Roman use. By the second quarter of the 3rd c. BCE, Rome was capable of minting its own issues of silver and bronze coins. The frequency and scale of these issues, however, stagnates in the middle of the century, before increasing in the second half of the century. During the late 3rd c. BCE, there was a great deal of change in the currency, as certain denominations were abandoned and as the purities and weight standards of other denominations were reduced. This debasement and weight reduction were the result of Rome’s military campaigns during this time period, particularly the Punic campaigns. The greatest change occurred when Rome introduced the silver denarius in 211 BCE, which corresponds with a drastic reduction in the weight of the <span class="rend-i">as</span>, the principle bronze denomination.</p>
        <p>The later phases of the Tincu House, Phases B-2 and B-3, produced coins representing these varied denominational standards. The poor condition of the coins has been discussed and attributed to prolonged periods of use or circulation, based on the appearance of the flan’s surface. For Phases B-2 and B-3, it could be possible to dismiss the early 3rd c. coins (Δ238b and Δ268) as residual artifacts. This may certainly be the case for Δ268, from Phase B-3, since dumping activity characterizes this period and since this coin is quite removed in time from the mid-2nd c. coin Δ434, also associated with this phase. Yet these earlier coins may indicate that bronze coinage experienced a long life at Gabii. The limited and sporadic issues of coinage during the Mid-Republican period would have encouraged the extended use of bronze coins. The value of these coins, a necessity for smaller transactions, was likely based on their weight rather than their supposed denomination. This must certainly be the case for any issues of the early 3rd c. BCE that are still in circulation at the end of that century.</p>

        <div class="textindentlevelx">
        <a name="2.6.3"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Notable objects from the Tincu House</span></h4>
        <p>Beyond the ceramics and coins, a variety of objects were recovered during the excavation of the house. While most of these did not derive from stratigraphic contexts that can be securely associated with specific activities in the house, we suggest some correlations between the assemblages of notable objects and the activities associated with its various phases of use. The first phase, when the house is in use as a house, produced numerous loom weights, a spindle whorl, delicate bronze nails, fibula fragments, and a bone bead, among other items. Phase B-2, when the site served a more public function, has few finds. A fragment preserving two different scenes from a small terracotta altar (Δ213) was found in a collapse layer. Descriptions of the scenes are recorded below in the section on notable objects under “Details.” Phase B-3, a period of abandonment and dumping, unsurprisingly produced the most finds, including a broken but complete bone hairpin (Δ139) and a lead slingshot bullet (Δ144). Most of the finds from this layer, however, are highly fragmentary and a mix of domestic or personal items and utilitarian, even industrial refuse, such as the iron crucible slag (Δ585). While specific conclusions further than this are not possible at present, the character of each assemblage remains suggestive.</p>

        <p>The results of the archaeobotanical study of the property defined by the Tincu House are quite limited due to the character of the strata, which are dominated by construction and dumping layers that do not lend themselves to the preservation of meaningful ecofact assemblages. A handful of cereal crops (<span class="rend-i">Triticum</span> sp. and <span class="rend-i">Hordeum vulgare</span>) have been retrieved among mostly unidentifiable remains.This lack of data is a further strong indication of what was argued in the <span class="ref"><a href="/g/gabii/introduction#div2_methods-archaeobotany" target="_blank">introductory volume</a></span>.

        <div class="textindentlevelx">
        <a name="2.6.5"></a><h4><span class="rend-i">Zooarchaeological Evidence from the Tincu House</span></h4>
        <p id="p_more-zooarch">Little can be said based on the faunal assemblage recovered from the Tincu House. The bones recovered were highly fragmented, making the accurate identification of species difficult. During the property's domestic inhabitation phase, the livestock is dominated by pigs, with ovicaprines and cattle making up the rest of the assemblage. While individual pigs outnumber the other domestic species, cattle represent the bulk of the meat supply. The cattle consumed here are adult, and the range of ages represented in the assemblage suggests that they were primarily serving as a food supply, though exostosis and robust tendon attachments hint at their use as a labor force. The ovicaprines present, based on the distribution of ages, were likely exploited for milk and wool as well as being part of the meat supply. That relatively young pigs and piglets dominate the assemblage may suggest a certain level of wealth, as the occupants of the house could afford to consume immature animals. Fish and shellfish are very rare, as are birds, suggesting that the local diet centered on red meat.</p>
        <p>Beyond these generalities, we can note that butchery marks are infrequent but present and that they represent all parts of the carcass-processing cycle. There is nothing to suggest that the animals are being butchered on site or that there is a preference for a particular method of preparation. There is virtually no evidence of burning, which hints at food preparation methods using indirect heat. Stewing, boiling, and braising, rather than grilling or roasting, should be imagined. This is typical for domestic consumption assemblages for central Italian urban centers. Interestingly, the same picture of consumption is seen in the second phase, when the use of the building transitions from domestic to public. This consistency across a clear transition in the use of the space should be considered together with the fact that the majority of the assemblage for both phases is derived from the fills of drains located just outside the walls of the house. Taken together, these facts suggest that the consumption pattern we are seeing may be a general one at Gabii and not limited to or tightly associated with this particular house. The bones found in the three stratigraphic units that make up much of the sample likely accumulated from upslope and through intentional dumping. Consequently, much of what we see is likely not in its primary depositional context. The same may be said for the faunal assemblage found in the dumps that accumulate as the property goes out of active use in Phase B-3. These remains likely represent the pattern of consumption at Gabii more generally. In this later phase, we can note a broad increase in the number of avian bones present, in particular chicken (<span class="rend-i">Gallus gallus</span>), and surmise that fowl became a larger part of the Gabine diet over time.</p>

        <a name="2.7"></a><h3><span class="rend-i">Conclusion</span></h3>
        <p id="p_more-streetnetwork">It seems clear that the development of the Area B plot altered the previous settlement organization radically. This suggests that the new urban layout was the result of a site-wide redistribution of property, which, in turn, implies the existence of a public, central authority capable of imposing and coordinating the spatial reconfiguration of the city. It comes as no surprise to see that public monumental writing appears in the same period (Fortson and Potter 2011; Johnston 2015). While comparable sites in the region (e.g., Rome) seemed to grow “organically” over time (i.e., with the multiple foci that composed the early settlement expanding slowly and occupying the free areas over time), the urban development of Gabii was the result of a sudden, centralized process.</p>
        <p id="p_more-phase0-transition">The ceramics found and not found in <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=div3_details-phase0-ceramics;view=fulltext">Phase B-0</a></span> and <span class="ref"><a href="https://jmcglone.quod.lib.umich.edu/g/gabii/mpub9231782?trgt=div3_details-phase1-ceramics;view=fulltext">Phase B-1</a></span> of the Area B plot support the idea of a total transformation of the property, associated with the laying out of the town's street grid, and a possible gap in the active use of this area. The ceramics associated with the Phase B-0 structures date between the Iron Age and the 5th c. BCE—the date of the creation of the street system, as established through the excavation of two road sequences (Mogetta and Becker 2014). The ceramics associated with Phase B-1a and the construction of the house date to 280–260 BCE. There is no evidence for activity or occupation on the plot between the construction of the road system in the later part of the 5th c. BCE and the construction of the house as we find it in the early 3rd c. BCE. How can we explain a gap of over 100 years in this area? The situation finds parallels at Pompeii and elsewhere at Gabii (Area D), where a block appears never to be reoccupied after the 5th c. BCE rearrangement associated with the street system (Mogetta and Becker 2014). At Pompeii, the orthogonal blocks in the northwest and east sectors of town were laid out during the later 4th and 3rd c. BCE (Geertman 2007), but the infill is only very gradual, intensifying in the late 3rd or early 2nd c. BCE (e.g., in the Regio VI: Coarelli and Pesando 2006, 2011). While it is possible that traces of some activity dating to the 4th c. BCE are masked by the construction of the house, it is equally likely that the lot stood empty for a time before being purchased and built upon as part of an ongoing process of urbanization. The situation in the Area B plot adds to the body of evidence offering a more nuanced view of the process of becoming urban.</p>
        <p id="p_more-intro-transformations">Several features of the Area B structure in Phase B-1 demonstrate that the housing project was well integrated with the overall urbanization program. The collection and disposal of surface waters was needed especially in the case of abutting houses and/or adjoining terraces. A gap was left between the cut in the bedrock and the back wall of the house, creating a channel that connected with the main drain. The wall delimiting the house on its west side functioned as a physical boundary of the property as well as a formal street frontage. The building technique chosen for this side of the structure, which features at least a course of large ashlar blocks, shows much greater quality and accuracy than that of the interior structures, which are built with smaller blocks of now highly degraded tufo. A reason for this may be that there was an attempt at beautifying the facades on this particular street, which was located at a crucial node of the town plan where it intersected further downslope with the main artery, at its junction with the important regional road to Praeneste. As discussed above, the impetus for this project could actually have come directly from the civic institutions (the phenomenon is particularly well known in the Greek context, especially in the case of intra-urban processional roads: e.g., Selinus; see Mertens 2006, 172–183). Similarly, the transformation of the house in Phase B-2, when an entrance was inserted in the corner of the courtyard, can be linked with broader public building interventions, including the paving of Road 4 (Gallone, Mogetta, and Johnston 2016). The road surface was widened at this time, encroaching on the western part of the property, and a drive branching off the main road was added to give access to the courtyard through its new entrance. On the opposite side of this drive was the access to a large complex, probably a public building. The rearrangement and substantial renovations of the Tincu House, the paving of Road 4, and the public building west of Road 4 suggest a significant change in the use and character of this part of the town. In short, the evidence from the Tincu House, combined with the large-scale data collected by the Gabii Project, allows us a glimpse into the actual negotiations between public and private interests that may have brought about and shaped urban forms at other multi-phased sites in the region.</p>

        <p id="p_details-levellayers1"><span class="rend-b">Leveling Layers</span></p>
        <p id="p_details-topography">The initial stages of construction of the house included leveling deposits and the cutting of drainage and other infrastructure. In some areas, the topography was regularized by means of leveling layers deposited prior to construction. This construction almost entirely obliterates traces of previous occupation and activity, leaving us with the scant remains described as belonging to Phase B-0. Leveling layer <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1399')">SU 1399</a></span> was deposited on top of earlier surface <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1462')">1462</a></span> in Room B4. <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1204')">SU 1204</a></span>, a reddish-orange layer of soil and tufo, also covers previous activity layer <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1223')">SU 1223</a></span>. It is possible that this layer’s color and composition can be attributed to activities related to the heating of tufo blocks for the preparation of subsequent floor surfaces probably associated with this period of construction. On top of this layer, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1205')">SU 1205</a></span> seems to have been deposited to regularize the slope and level of Room B5 for the construction of the house.</p>
        <p><span class="rend-b">Northern and Eastern Drainage System</span></p>
        <p id="p_details-earlydrains">The construction of drains occurs early in the building of the house. Along the northern and eastern perimeter of the property, a sewer, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1322')">SU 1322</a></span>, was cut into the bedrock and likely served as the drainage ditch for the northern side of the structure. Portions of the northern wall are still visible adjacent to this cut, although both wall and cut are heavily eroded. A double cut formed by <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1476')">SUs 1476</a></span> and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1322')">1322</a></span> was made parallel to the eastern side of the house, and a stone lining (<span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1402')">SU 1402</a></span>) was built within it. Another stone feature, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1348')">1348</a></span>/<span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1398')">1398</a></span>, was built of irregular basalt blocks against the eastern wall of the house and along the western edge of the sewer. This construction served as a retaining wall and raised and leveled the irregular bedrock. Fills accumulated in these drains. <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1465')">SU 1465</a></span> is an early fill of the sewer cut, while <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1279')">SU 1279</a></span> and its continuation <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1385')">SU 1385</a></span> both appear to have accumulated in the drain later in its use. These deposits are dense, and a variety of materials are present, from ceramics to bones. As stated elsewhere, their contents likely reflect the detritus of the neighborhood rather than exclusively the refuse of this house.</p>
        <p><span class="rend-b">The Courtyard</span></p>
        <p id="p_details-phase1-courtyard">Originally a single courtyard associated with a large crushed tufo floor, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1173')">1173</a></span> (= SUs 1215, 1231, 1216, 1255) occupied the western two-thirds of the house. The cocciopesto floor was constructed with a stratum of crushed red tufo and low-quality plaster. This surface has been truncated by several different phases of walls, later burials, and a massive robbery trench, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1229')">1229</a></span> (which exposed the drainage system for the courtyard, discussed below), as well as structures installed during the reorganization of the southwest corner of the house.</p>
        <p id="p_details-phase1-courtyardwall">At its fullest extent, the courtyard was bound by <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1245')">western wall SU 1245</a></span>, northern wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1217')">1217</a></span>, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">1390</a></span> to the south, and SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1183')">1183</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1469')">1469</a></span>, and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1393')">1393</a></span> to the east. The western courtyard wall, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1245')">1245</a></span>, is preserved entirely except for its southern limit. Originally built of large oblong ashlars, it was later patched with tiles and irregular, small tufo blocks. The northern wall, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1217')">1217</a></span>, is heavily robbed to the east and broadly poorly preserved. Its extant ashlar blocks stand on only a thin layer of accumulated sand, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1313')">1313</a></span>, which rests directly on the bedrock. No direct evidence of a binding agent was noted, although some of ashlars show traces of horizontal cutting, possibly representing preparation and roughing of the surface for a binding agent. Of similar construction but better preserved, the wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1183')">1183</a></span> runs north-south, separating a series of rooms along the eastern side of the house (Rooms 1, 2, 3, and 6) from the courtyard. This wall is truncated in the south where it abuts east-west wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1184')">1184</a></span>. Two short sections of wall, SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1469')">1469</a></span> and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1393')">1393</a></span>, continue toward the southern courtyard wall <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">SU 1390</a></span> along the north-south axis of SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1183')">1183</a></span>. SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1469')">1469</a></span> uses mixed techniques, including ashlar blocks, rubble, and tile inclusions, while SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1393')">1393</a></span> was constructed in opus incertum. In spite of the mix of techniques, these segments of wall likely serve a single function—to separate the courtyard from the eastern rooms of the building.</p>
        <p><span class="rend-b">The Drains and Well in the Courtyard</span></p>
        <p id="p_details-courtyarddrains">Two sets of features related to water management are present in the courtyard during Phase B-1, with partial continued use into Phase B-2. In the southwest corner, we find a set of structures clearly intended to drain water away from the property. A rock-cut channel, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1228')">1228</a></span>, and the soil accumulated within it, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1221')">1221</a></span>, were exposed by the excavation of a portion of floor SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1173')">1173</a></span>, running parallel to the wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1245')">1245</a></span>, along the western edge of the courtyard. The channel was covered by a series of large tufo slabs, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1230')">1230</a></span>. These tufo coverings are held in place by an extremely large ashlar block, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1410')">1410</a></span>, which sits directly to the east of the channel. Looking into the channel, it clearly forms a T juncture with another drainage conduit heading west toward Road 4. In the northern part of the courtyard, a well, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1257')">1257</a></span>, is cut into the bedrock and covered by large well-cut tufo slabs, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1188')">1188</a></span>. No further evidence of a superstructure is present for the well. It is simply accessed from the courtyard’s surface.</p>
        <p id="p_details-phase1-rooms"><span class="rend-b">Rooms</span></p>
        <p id="p_details-phase1-walls">The walls that delimit Room B1—SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1183')">1183</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1184')">1184</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1185')">1185</a></span>, and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1250')">1250</a></span>—are all poorly preserved, with only a few courses or part of a single course remaining. SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1183')">1183</a></span> is discussed above. SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1184')">1184</a></span> is a smaller east-west wall that abuts SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1183')">1183</a></span> to the west and SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1185')">1185</a></span> and, later, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1387')">1387</a></span> to the west, separating Rooms B1 and B6. SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1250')">1250</a></span> is an east-west opus quadratum wall that divides Rooms B1 and B2. A gap between east wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1183')">1183</a></span> of these two rooms and SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1250')">1250</a></span> suggests an entranceway. However, poor preservation means that the presence of a doorway here is uncertain.</p>
        <p id="p_details-phase1-floors">Remnants of a cocciopesto floor, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1178')">1178</a></span>, were identified in Room B1 abutting the dividing wall, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1250')">1250</a></span>, to the north. Several layers of preparation under this floor, including SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1179')">1179</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1180')">1180</a></span>, and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1181')">1181</a></span>, were preserved. These floors layered on top of one another indicate episodes of repair and resurfacing. We see a similar pattern in other rooms of the house, particularly those on the eastern side of the courtyard that were in use from Phase 1a through Phase B-2. While the latest floor surface and top preparation layers, SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1179')">1179</a></span> and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1180')">1180</a></span> (a gravel layer and a crushed tufo preparation layer respectively), are truncated, the deepest preparation layer, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1181')">1181</a></span>, is intact and is bounded by all four walls of Room B1.</p>
        <p>Room B2 is bounded by walls SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1183')">1183</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1250')">1250</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1185')">1185</a></span>, and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1299')">1299</a></span>. SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1299')">1299</a></span> is built using mixed techniques, with both ashlar and rubble masonry present. This wall divides Rooms B2 and B3; it abuts SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1183')">1183</a></span> to the west and SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1309')">1309</a></span> to the east where the latter ends, and SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1185')">1185</a></span> abuts it to the south, serving as the eastern wall for Rooms B1 and B2. A crushed tufo floor is preserved in two small patches, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1244')">1244</a></span>, in Room B2. This floor abuts a dividing wall, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1299')">1299</a></span>, to the north and SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1183')">1183</a></span> to the east, and it clearly belongs to the same occupation phase.</p>
        <p id="p_details-phase1-room3floors">SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1399')">1399</a></span> and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1321')">1321</a></span> are layers deposited in Room B3 to raise the level for the construction of a floor that would have been in phase with walls SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1299')">1299</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1183')">1183</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1309')">1309</a></span>, and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1308')">1308</a></span> but was not preserved. These soil and rubble leveling layers, SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1399')">1399</a></span> and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1321')">1321</a></span>, were deposited over the earlier surface SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1462')">1462</a></span>. The ashlar tufo wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1309')">1309</a></span> serves as the eastern boundary of this room and the structure; interestingly, it jogs slightly to the west from the other eastern limiting wall, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1185')">1185</a></span>, which continues to the south of SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1299')">1299</a></span>, bounding Rooms B1 and B2. The tufo ashlar wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1308')">1308</a></span> bounds the room and structure to the north. Construction cut SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1395')">1395</a></span>, cut into bedrock, runs the entire east-west length of the structure, suggesting that walls SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1308')">1308</a></span> and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1217')">1217</a></span> are likely two fragments of the same wall.</p>
        <p>Room B6, located in the southeast corner of the structure, was bounded by the wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1184')">1184</a></span> in the north, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">1390</a></span> to the south, and the rubble continuation, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1387')">1387</a></span>, of ashlar wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1185')">1185</a></span> to the east. The western limit of Room B6 is composed of two wall fragments: SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1469')">1469</a></span> is built using mixed techniques, including ashlar blocks, rubble, and tile inclusions, while SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1393')">1393</a></span> was constructed using the opus incertum technique. Both walls SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1469')">1469</a></span> and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1393')">1393</a></span> were truncated by a grave (cut SU 1437), which revealed the construction cut, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1475')">1475</a></span>, of wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1393')">1393</a></span>.</p>
        <p id="p_details-phase2-courtyarddoor">SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1386')">1386</a></span> is a later fill within Room B6 that consisted of a large amount of tufo, basalt, and cut stone debris. This fill, based on the dates of its ceramic inclusions, belongs to the substantial renovations of Phase B-2. At the time of excavation, the excavators were uncertain of the extent of this SU and noted that there is likely contamination from the silty soil above, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1327')">1327</a></span> (clear from its broad date range: see below). During the course of excavation, the western limit of the SU was noted as extending through the gap between walls SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1469')">1469</a></span> and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1184')">1184</a></span> and out of Room B6, implying that there may have been a doorway there and that the fill might have extended or been treaded out toward the west. The suggested doorway would have served as the entrance from the courtyard to the rooms of the structure during its Phase B-2 use, when the building was associated with the adjacent public building. While the excavators noted that SU 1386 seemed to cover walls SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">1390</a></span> and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1448')">1448</a></span>, the thinness of this cover, less than one centimeter, suggests erosion and thus does not affect the interpretation of the layer as a leveling fill in the room.</p>
        <p id="p_details-phase1b"><span class="rend-b">Phase B-1b: The southern addition</span></p>
        <p id="p_details-phase1b-south">Wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">1390</a></span> runs east-west along what appears to be the southern limit of the structure in Phase 1a. It is very likely that, in its initial construction, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">1390</a></span> continued west to meet SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1245')">1245</a></span>. This configuration was altered by the installation of a new entrance to the house in the southeast corner of the courtyard as part of the Phase B-2 reorganization. SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">1390</a></span> features a different building technique than many of the walls in the northern part of the building, comprising irregular blocks and rubble. Two north-south walls built in the same technique, SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1448')">1448</a></span> and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1449')">1449</a></span>, seem to be contemporary with SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">1390</a></span>. Several more features are preserved south of SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">1390</a></span>. Worked block SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1454')">1454</a></span> lies slightly southwest of wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1448')">1448</a></span> and may have been once part of this wall or used as a threshold. The alignment of this worked block and two circular stone presses, SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1507')">1507</a></span> and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1429')">1429</a></span>, suggests that they have been displaced. This interpretation is further supported by the fact that all three are floating above intact stratigraphy and just under the top soil. While SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1507')">1507</a></span> is almost completely obliterated by wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1448')">1448</a></span>, stone vessel <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1429')">1429</a></span>, filled by SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1430')">1430</a></span>, was placed within cut SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1432')">1432</a></span> and fill SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1431')">1431</a></span>. Additionally, a floor preparation, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1470')">1470</a></span>, abuts the south face of wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">1390</a></span>. SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1397')">1397</a></span>, a tufo slab, is embedded in this preparation and is presumably related to the drainage channels visible in the courtyard to the north. SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">1390</a></span> itself and this collection of features south of it are interpreted as making up the main addition to the house carried out in Phase 1b or as related to later activity in this area. While this interpretation must remain tentative because of prior excavations, it seems to provide the best explanation for the presence of further rooms on this terrace built using a mix of techniques and seemingly “added on” to the main structure.</p>

        <p>In Phase B-2, the north-south street running along the western side of the property was widened, and a Y junction was added, providing a new route of access to the property, now serving as an annex to the public building across the road (Area F). This drive is paved with basalt slabs (SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1400')">1400</a></span>) and terminates at the threshold (SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1394')">1394</a></span>) marking the entrance to the building. The upper step of the threshold preserves two circular depressions, one on each side, with rusted rings worn into the stone—suggesting double doors. A new side wall (SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1391')">1391</a></span>) was built to retain the basalt paving blocks, running northwest-southeast from the threshold and along the eastern limit of the road. Both the enlarged pavement, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1400')">1400</a></span>, and wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1391')">1391</a></span> truncate SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">1390</a></span>, which is clearly visible between the first and second northernmost ashlars of SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1391')">1391</a></span>. Further, the western part of SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">1390</a></span> was incorporated in a new structure, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1415')">1415</a></span>, adjacent to the roadside wall. The paving of the road, which we date to ca. 150 BCE, provides tentative links to a wider increased use of all-weather paved roads in urban contexts in central Italy. The earliest road pavements in Rome were built by the censors of 174 BCE (Livy 41.27.5–13), and the limestone pavement of the street grid of the south neighborhood at Norba also seems to date to the 2nd c. BCE.</p>
        <p id="p_details-phase2-vestibule">To the west of the threshold SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1394')">1394</a></span> sits an ashlar block, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1508')">1508</a></span>, which is misaligned both with the threshold and also with wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1245')">1245</a></span> further west. An ashlar block, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1414')">1414</a></span>, sits to the east of the threshold and to the north of the pavement and wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1391')">1391</a></span>. The threshold leads onto the remains of a crushed tufo floor, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1477')">1477</a></span>, to the north, which may not have extended much further north at the same level, as there are two small tufo blocks to the northeast, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1504')">1504</a></span>. Together, these features are interpreted as forming a small vestibule. Additionally, two more tufo blocks, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1505')">1505</a></span>, were found sitting slightly northeast of the threshold and may have originally been part of the construction of this entrance.</p>

        <p id="p_details-phase2-westentrance">An area of masonry patching, SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('5018')">5018</a></span>, was identified in the western wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1245')">1245</a></span>, located adjacent to the drain SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1230')">1230</a></span>. This patch in the wall, of a size appropriate for a doorway, is interpreted as the original entrance to the house. This entrance, it seems, was blocked up, likely concurrently with the construction of the new entrance in the southwest corner of the courtyard and the repurposing of the building. This interpretation is further bolstered by an extremely shallow construction cut and fill, SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('5017')">5017</a></span> and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('5016')">5016</a></span> respectively, identified on the western side of SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1254')">1254</a></span> and <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('5018')">5018</a></span> during the excavation of the north-south road adjacent to the entrance. The shallowness of the cut and fill suggests that the construction of SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('5018')">5018</a></span> required only the removal of a small amount of accumulated material in the road, consistent with the idea that SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('5018')">5018</a></span> represents a modification of an existing structure.</p>

A third infant burial, tomb 32, is of similar date. This burial is roughly aligned to the exterior eastern wall of the house.

The presence of burials indicates, if nothing else, that the drain was no longer in use. This implies that the house was no longer being maintained, though the drain and walls were likely visible. While the presence of infant burials under the eaves of occupied houses is common in central Italy, the association of burials with buildings abandoned or transformed for industrial use is more tenuous.</p>

        <a name="3.3"></a><h3><span class="rend-i">Building materials and local tufo—by Jason Farr</span></h3>
        <p id="p_details-tufo">The Tincu House was built using locally available stone resources, chiefly derived from two separate geological deposits known in the archaeological literature as lapis Gabinus (geologically, the Valle Castiglione ground surge deposit) and tufo lionato (the Villa Senni Eruption Unit). Both are varieties of tufo (in English, tuff) that appear frequently at Rome, where archaeologists have identified them in numerous ancient monuments (for an excellent overview see Jackson and Marra 2006). The lapis Gabinus deposit is found, as the name implies, only in the immediate area of Gabii, including beneath the city itself; the bedrock directly underlying the house, in fact, consists of this type of tufo. The main quarries, many of which are still visible, lie just beyond the city walls to the northeast and are the subject of ongoing research. The tufo lionato deposit, by contrast, can be found over a much wider area. While the famous Aniene quarries are about 10 kilometers to the northwest along the Aniene River, outcrops can also be identified along the Fosso del Ossa, which runs northwest from Osteria dell’Ossa, just west of Gabii, to the Aniene at Lunghezza. Blocks of both varieties of tufo could thus have been extracted locally, probably within a kilometer or two from the house.</p>
        <p>Identification of geologically distinct tuffs is not always possible macroscopically, and archaeologists have, in the past, conflated or confused different varieties. In our work at Gabii, we have the advantage of on-site comparison with the lapis Gabinus bedrock, and, furthermore, the tuffs with which it is sometimes confused are not local to the area of Gabii. In addition, a number of samples were taken from the excavated remains and analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass-Spectrometry (ICP) mass spectrometry, allowing accurate measurement of trace elements such as zirconium, yttrium, niobium, thorium, and tantalum (Farr, Marra, and Terrenato 2015). The ratios between these elements provide a geochemical signature that is unique to a given tufo deposit, allowing us to determine the source of each sample. While no samples have been analyzed from the Tincu House, results from elsewhere in the excavations support the visual identifications below.</p>
        <p>In the initial construction phase of the house, ashlar blocks of lapis Gabinus were used almost exclusively in the opus quadratum walls, at least in the limited number of courses that are preserved. This includes the original northern boundary of the courtyard (SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1217')">1217</a></span>) and the walls of Rooms B1, B2, and B3 (SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1183')">1183</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1184')">1184</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1185')">1185</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1250')">1250</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1299')">1299</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1308')">1308</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1309')">1309</a></span>). Blocks vary somewhat in size and are very badly eroded in places but average about 50 cm long, 40 cm wide, and 27 cm high. The southern boundary of the courtyard (SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1390')">1390</a></span>) and the early additions just beyond it to the southeast (SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1448')">1448</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1449')">1449</a></span>) were built of irregular blocks of lapis Gabinus in combination with rubble. The western wall of the courtyard (SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1245')">1245</a></span>), however, contains a few blocks of tufo lionato, but this may be due to later patching activity. In this early phase, tufo lionato is mainly associated, it seems, with the drainage features of the area: the well-cut carved slabs covering the wellhead (SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1188')">1188</a></span>) and the large slabs covering the channel itself (SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1230')">1230</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1410')">1410</a></span>). It also appears in the crushed tufo floor levels throughout the house in this and later phases.</p>
        <p>In the second phase, we see both types of tufo in the construction of the new southern entrance to the courtyard. The threshold itself (SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1394')">1394</a></span>) is lapis Gabinus, as are the fragmentary blocks just within that may have delimited a small vestibule (SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1504')">1504</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1505')">1505</a></span>). The small blocks adjacent to the threshold (SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1414')">1414</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1508')">1508</a></span>) and the nearby wall (SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1391')">1391</a></span>) associated with the basalt paving of the street beyond it are constructed of tufo lionato, though SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1391')">1391</a></span> transitions to lapis Gabinus where it extends south beyond the area of the house. The new walls (SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1186')">1186</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1187')">1187</a></span>) that break up the former open space of the courtyard were built with a mix of materials: larger lapis Gabinus ashlars, most notable in the well-cut blocks at the corner of these walls, and smaller rubble consisting of both types of tuff in addition to roof tiles, basalt, and even travertine. The basalt is probably reused material from nearby street pavements, but it is worth noting that the lava flows from which it must have been extracted lie within two kilometers to the east and west. The small amounts of fragmentary travertine, a stone imported from Tivoli some distance away, are almost certainly reused from an earlier context, perhaps decorative.</p>
        <p>In the dramatic reorganization of Phase B-3, the wall (SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1058')">1058</a></span>) built west of courtyard wall SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1245')">1245</a></span> was constructed with irregular blocks of both types of tuff, and the new walls within the former house (SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1135')">1135</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1163')">1163</a></span>) were built with small rubble of various materials.</p>
        <p>A number of factors must have been involved in the choice of building materials for the Tincu House, including cost, availability, and the physical properties of the stone. Both lapis Gabinus and tufo lionato were readily available at this time, as they appear throughout the city and in much earlier structures, and the proximity of the quarries would have limited transportation costs for each. Lapis Gabinus is slightly heavier and harder to cut, but, for these reasons, it is more durable and has significant load-bearing capacity. It seems the builders of the house may have understood these qualities, utilizing the more durable lapis Gabinus for the load-bearing walls of the house and the high-traffic threshold and using the lighter tufo lionato for the very large slabs of the drainage features, which would have been more difficult to transport. It is notable that even in the later walls built mainly of rubble, lapis Gabinus blocks were used (or perhaps reused) in key locations such as the lowest course or the corners.</p>
        <p>These findings suggest that stoneworkers at Gabii had an excellent understanding of the structural properties of the local stones, long before lapis Gabinus was introduced at Rome, which was probably no earlier than the mid-2nd c. BCE. The Tincu House thus demonstrates the expertise of Gabine builders and provides an alternative perspective on the economy of stone construction in Mid-Republican Latium, which has usually been approached through the immense public monuments of Rome.</p>

        <p id="p_details-archaeobotany">The sampling and recovery strategy for faunal and botanical remains in Area B has taken into consideration the depositional history of the contexts and has been informed by a previous experiment carried out in Area A, where a similar stratigraphic sequence had been excavated. In Area A, 40 SUs, interpreted as general fill layers of Late Republican or Imperial periods, have been selected to evaluate recovery rate and identification potential for different kinds of materials in extremely mixed tertiary deposits rich in construction debris. For each SU, in addition to normal excavation routine and sampling for flotation, four 10 L samples have been sieved with a 6 mm mesh and wet sieved (in order to allow the sediment to pass through the mesh) with a 2 mm mesh. The cultural material found in each procedure has been kept and analyzed separately. The excavation and processing of every SU has also been timed, and the total excavated volume has been recorded. A formal comparison of the results for the different recovery –methods—flotation, dry screening, wet screening, and visual recovery—is still in progress. However, a preliminary assessment shows that while flotation and the addition of the screened samples has obviously improved the recovery of small fragments in all classes of material, their analysis has revealed a surprisingly low number of identifiable and quantifiable remains in the assemblage. Moreover, their recovery is associated with a considerable increase in excavation time. Significantly, these fragmented and unidentifiable remains do not add any quantitative and/or qualitative information to the dataset for these kinds of context.</p>
        <p>Most of the deposits in Area B can be assigned to domestic contexts, including built features (e.g., floor preparations and walls) and fills deposited between different phases of occupation, post-abandonment layers, and burials. These layers are characterized by a very high proportion of older residual ceramics (Ferrandes, this volume) and a great density of building material. In keeping with the observations made above, a blanket sampling strategy and total screening were not deemed appropriate. Instead, flotation samples have been taken from specific contexts following a well-judged sampling strategy based on prior knowledge of urban deposits in general and at Gabii in particular. Sampled SUs have been selected according to their composition and stratigraphic position to further test the suitability of such deposits for the recovery of archaeobotanical material and to provide a control sample for small animal bones. Only sediments from the burials have been dry screened with a 5 mm mesh to provide a total recovery of body parts and possible grave goods.</p>
        <p>The majority of the ecofacts from the Tincu House have thus been hand collected during the excavation of the deposits. Excavators were specifically instructed to pay particular attention to botanical and faunal remains and to collect any wood charcoal bigger than the little fingernail, as well as any animal bone fragment or anatomical piece regardless of size. Although visual recovery is regarded as unreliable because heavily biased toward larger remains and potentially spatially uneven, it could be the most cost-effective method for obtaining a representative assemblage of ecofacts when dealing with these kinds of deposit. Especially when charred plant remains are few and far apart or very fragmented, carefully handpicked charcoals increase the number of identifiable taxa compared to that retrieved with flotation (see below). Furthermore, the range and occurrence of small faunal remains, including mollusks, fish, birds, and small mammal bones, turned out to be similar to that in the floated samples. Only microfauna such as small rodents (mice) are underrepresented in the handpicked remains. As a result, the hand-collected bone assemblage is characterized by a good recovery rate and can be considered to be largely representative (Alhaique, this volume).</p>
        <p>Thirty-two samples have been collected from general fill layers and dumps between floors of the Tincu House. For each SU, 20 L of sediment have been processed with a machine-assisted flotation system. A standard sample size, rather than a standard sample fraction, has been implemented, for practical reasons and to assure better comparability of the remains (Pearsall 2015, 75-76; Lee 2012). Prior experience in urban central Italian stratigraphy, together with the evaluation of the average quantity of charred material recovered in other contexts at Gabii, determined the appropriate sample size (Motta 2011).</p>
        <p>Flotation was carried out on site with a machine built by the project. High-pressure tap water from the main water line supplies the flotation tank through a showerhead at the bottom of the tub. Geological and archaeological material is collected in a removable 1 mm inside screen, while floating remains overflow in an external geological 0.25 mm sieve. The heavy fraction has been sorted in the field during the excavation season. It included fragments of charcoal and microfauna bones. Light fractions have been analyzed in the archaeobotany lab at the University of Michigan, using a stereozoom microscope 10–100x. In the flots, charred plant remains are scarce and very small: in particular, carpological remains have been found in five samples only (SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1168')">1168</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1169')">1169</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1277')">1277</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1300')">1300</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1341')">1341</a></span>). The great majority of charcoal and almost all the charred seeds are not identifiable at any taxonomic level, due to fragmentation and preservation issues. Densities are also extremely low: the richest sample (SU <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1300')">1300</a></span>) contained 50 items.</p>
        <p>No significant results can be presented for the carpological analysis: a handful of cereal crops (<span class="rend-i">Triticum</span> sp. and <span class="rend-i">Hordeum vulgare</span>) have been retrieved among mostly unidentifiable remains. This lack of data is a further strong indication of what was argued above. In a Roman urban context for the Late Republican and Imperial periods, this kind of mixed tertiary deposit, extremely rich in building and residual material, is not a good candidate for the collection of flotation samples aimed at the analysis of archaeobotanical remains. Wood charcoal is still under study by R. Veal: it is worth noting that only four samples (SUs <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1168')">1168</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1320')">1320</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1327')">1327</a></span>, <span class="ref"><a class="unity" onclick="getToUnity('1385')">1385</a></span>) contained fragments big enough to be identifiable, in contrast with the handpicked charcoal collected from 26 different SUs. Microfauna description is included in the following discussion of faunal remains.</p>
